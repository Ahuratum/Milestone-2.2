                    I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 10 minutes from the city.
                    I attended a local Catholic school until the young age of 13,
                    where I moved 40 minutes away. During my early, formative years, I was
                    bursting with curiosity. I spent majority of my time playing video games
                    and taking apart electronics around the house. From the television remote
                    to my remote control cars, nothing was safe from being disassembled.

                    At the age of 15, I moved to Port Saint Lucie, Florida. I spent the next 7
                    years of my life working and finishing high school. It was during these years,
                    though, that my curiosity began to fade, without knowledge of it happening at the time.
                    After high school, I continued to work, unsure of what I wanted to do with my life.
                    while I still loved technology, I did not have any influence in my life
                    that would help guide me in the direction leading to my deepest passion.
                    I felt lost but I always found a light to follow.

                    At 22, I decided that I needed to leave Florida, go back to my home town, and find a path that would
                    lead me to my passion. I moved back to Pittsburgh and started a new chapter in my life. I worked in
                    several industries, during this time, including within a steel foundry and a local deli. Feeling lost,
                    once more, I reached out to a friend of my whom had moved to Puerto Rico as a child. Since His mother
                    and my mother were close friends, His mother had asked if I would like to move to Puerto Rico, where I
                    could bartend at a local bar she had owned at the time. My mother informed that I should take any
                    opportunity that I was offered in exploring the world while I was young. Taking this advice to heart, I
                    accepted the offer and spent a year in Puerto Rico. At 25, nearing 26, I felt I needed new experiences,
                    to visit new places; inevitably, to "break out my shell". I spent one year in Puerto Rico, meeting new
                    people, and learning the art of mixing spirits.

                    At 26, I was offered a chance to During my time at the electronics repair company, I was finally able to
                    take my first step on my current path. I fell in love with electronics again and my curiosity, that I
                    had lost years prior, had reignited. I spent the next two years learning the trade and even more about
                    electronics, programming, soldering, components, diagnostics, and repair. Soon enough, I had worked my
                    way up to management. I was given a company car and responsibility over two locations. While I loved my
                    role in the franchise, I was not able to continue to move up in the company without opening my own
                    franchise location. I, once again, started sending out my resumes with my acquired knowledge set, hoping
                    to find something that allows further growth.<br>

                    In June of 2018, I received a phone call regarding a position I had applied to, months earlier.
                    Initially, honestly, I had forgotten what the company produced and what the role was, that I applied
                    for, since it had been so long. I was informed that I would make a great fit and I was offered an
                    interview. I was asked routine questions during the interview but I provided depth to my answers, as I
                    was told, leading to the offering of the position as an electromechanical technician. I learned a vast
                    amount from this company, more than I had ever, from any other company. I was offered an "internship"
                    with the manufacturing engineering department, which I accepted graciously. In this role I was tasked
                    with documentation creation, including operational method sheets, standard operating procedures, and
                    designing of kaizen events, which lead to my training in Lean Six Sigma. Within this role, I was part of
                    a cross functioning team, dedicated to reducing waste, costs, and manufacturing defects. Work within
                    this team led me to working directly with software/firmware engineering departments where I was
                    introduced to the daily life of a programmer at a large corporation. I asked an engineer, whom had been
                    at the company for many years, if he would be able to make time at some point for me to sit down with
                    him and learn some more aspects of his role, as I had ambition of becoming a software engineer some day.
                    He promptly replied to my email with "Sure, Nick, lets set something up for next week". Without knowing
                    it, in one weeks time, I would finally decide that programming, problem solving, and continual learning
                    were my callings in life.I stayed in this role for two more before starting the next chapter in my
                    life!<br>

                    In 2021, I moved back to Florida; feeling the need for a fresh start and the desire to be closer to
                    family. I began looking into new roles within the area, quickly learning that the manufacturing and tech
                    industry was not as expansive as Pittsburgh. I was able to secure a position with a company as a support
                    engineer. Through this, I have been learning much about the new industry I entered, including photometry
                    and luminometry, biochemistry, firmware, and software.
